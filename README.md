 ✈️ Airline Booking Backend

A scalable microservices-based backend system for an Airline Booking Platform, built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **Sequelize ORM**, and **MySQL**. It supports dynamic flight search, booking management, and CRUD operations for core airline entities like flights, airplanes, airports, and cities.



 🚀 Features

- ✅ RESTful APIs for managing flights, bookings, airplanes, airports, and cities.
- 🔍 Advanced query filtering (by date, price, trip type, etc.)
- 🛫 Relational database schema with Sequelize (1-to-many, many-to-many relations)
- 🧱 Clean architecture: controller → service → repository layers
- 📦 Modular microservices structure for scalability
- ❗ Robust error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- 🧪 Ready for integration with frontend or other services
